##C - argc, arg
In C programming, argc stands for "argument count," and argv stands for "argument vector." These concepts are essential for passing and handling arguments when running a C program.
#argc keeps track of the number of arguments passed to the program.
#argv is an array that holds these arguments in the form of strings.
